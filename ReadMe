This framework is BDD page object model framework.

I used page object model to maintain the web elements and BDD you can check in the test > java > Features
In the feature files I used gherkin language to make the framework more understandable and each steps in the feature file are reusable.
Basically less code but same testing this way framework is east to maintain.

I used the singleton driver as well. Driver class is in the src > main > utilities > DriverClass. This helps me to use multiple page classes and page classes
for easy to maintain web elements.

I used ParentClass in the Pages package. This class is abstract because I have a multiple page classes and I need to switch between of them. Check the src>test>java> StepDefinition> stepUtils.
In this class I have multiple abstract methods. Which is pushing all the child class have the same method. This way I do not need to create a step definition for each page class. 

Run the Runner class it is in the src > main > java > Runners > RegressionRunner. After you run the runner class you can see the extends report. Which is in the target > ExtendReport.
This report has better UI for report.
To generate extendsreport check the runner class. Which has a after class and there is a plugin you need to get it is in the runner class(regression runner line 17).
There are two plugins in the pom.xml(extentreports,cucumber-extentsreport). And there is one file in the src > test > java > features > extendReports.xml this file should be in the same
location as feature files. Then run regression runner it will create a file under the target folder.
